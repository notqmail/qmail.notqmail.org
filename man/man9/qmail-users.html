     <B>NAME</B>
          qmail-users - assign mail addresses to users

     <B>OVERVIEW</B>
          The file <B>QMAILHOME/users/assign</B> assigns addresses to users.
          For example,

             =joe.shmoe:joe:503:78:/home/joe:::

          says that mail for <B>joe.shmoe</B> should be delivered to user
          <B>joe</B>, with uid 503 and gid 78, as specified by
          <B>/home/joe/.qmail</B>.

          Assignments fed to <B>qmail-newu</B> will be used by <B>qmail-lspawn</B>
          to control <B>qmail-local</B>'s deliveries.  See <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-newu.html">qmail-newu(8)</A></B>.  A
          change to <B>QMAILHOME/users/assign</B> will have no effect until
          <B>qmail-newu</B> is run.

     <B>STRUCTURE</B>
          <B>QMAILHOME/users/assign</B> is a series of assignments, one per
          line.  It ends with a line containing a single dot.  Lines
          must not contain NUL.

     <B>SIMPLE</B> <B>ASSIGNMENTS</B>
          A simple assignment is a line of the form

             =local:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:ext:

          Here <I>local</I> is an address; <I>user</I>, <I>uid</I>, and <I>gid</I> are the account
          name, uid, and gid of the user in charge of <I>local</I>; and
          messages to <I>local</I> will be controlled by
          <I>homedir</I><B>/.qmail</B><I>dashext</I>.

          If there are several assignments for the same <I>local</I> address,
          <B>qmail-lspawn</B> will use the first one.

          <I>local</I> is interpreted without regard to case.

     <B>WILDCARD</B> <B>ASSIGNMENTS</B>
          A wildcard assignment is a line of the form

             +loc:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:pre:

          This assignment applies to any address beginning with <I>loc</I>,
          including <I>loc</I> itself.  It means the same as

             =locext:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:preext:

          for every string <I>ext</I>.

          A more specific wildcard assignment overrides a less
          specific assignment, and a simple assignment overrides any
          wildcard assignment.  For example:

             +:alias:7790:2108:QMAILHOME/alias:-::
             +joe-:joe:507:100:/home/joe:-::
             =joe:joe:507:100:/home/joe:::

          The address <B>joe</B> is handled by the third line; the address
          <B>joe-direct</B> is handled by the second line; the address <B>bill</B>
          is handled by the first line.
