          qmail-limits - artificial limits in the qmail system

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          The <B>qmail</B> system is able to handle messages of any size,
          addresses of any size, mailing lists of any size, and so on,
          except as limited by the available memory and disk space.

          However, it imposes certain artificial limits:

          1.   <B>qmail-lspawn</B> silently limits the number of simultaneous
               local deliveries to SPAWN.  <B>qmail-rspawn</B> silently
               limits the number of simultaneous remote deliveries to
               SPAWN.

          2.   <B>qmail-queue</B> rejects any message with an envelope
               address longer than 1000 characters.

          3.   <B>qmail-lspawn</B> truncates any overly long error report
               from a delivery program.  It appends a note saying that
               it did so.
