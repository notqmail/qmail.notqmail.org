     <B>NAME</B>
          qmail-getpw - give addresses to users

     <B>SYNOPSIS</B>
          <B>qmail-getpw</B> <I>local</I>

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          In <B>qmail</B>, each user controls a vast array of local
          addresses.  <B>qmail-getpw</B> finds the user that controls a
          particular address, <I>local</I>.  It prints six pieces of
          information, each terminated by NUL:  <I>user</I>; <I>uid</I>; <I>gid</I>;
          <I>homedir</I>; <I>dash</I>; and <I>ext</I>.  The user's account name is <I>user</I>;
          the user's uid and gid in decimal are <I>uid</I> and <I>gid</I>; the
          user's home directory is <I>homedir</I>; and messages to <I>local</I> will
          be handled by <I>homedir</I><B>/.qmail</B><I>dashext</I>.

          In case of trouble, <B>qmail-getpw</B> exits nonzero without
          printing anything.

          <B>WARNING:</B> The operating system's <B>getpwnam</B> function, which is
          at the heart of <B>qmail-getpw</B>, is inherently unreliable:  it
          fails to distinguish between temporary errors and
          nonexistent users.  Future versions of <B>getpwnam</B> should
          return ETXTBSY to indicate temporary errors and ESRCH to
          indicate nonexistent users.

     <B>RULES</B>
          <B>qmail-getpw</B> considers an account in <B>/etc/passwd</B> to be a user
          if (1) the account has a nonzero uid, (2) the account's home
          directory exists (and is visible to <B>qmail-getpw</B>), and (3)
          the account owns its home directory.  <B>qmail-getpw</B> ignores
          account names containing uppercase letters.  <B>qmail-getpw</B>
          also assumes that all account names are shorter than 32
          characters.

          <B>qmail-getpw</B> gives each user control over the basic <I>user</I>
          address and all addresses of the form <I>user</I><B>BREAK</B><I>anything</I>.
          When <I>local</I> is <I>user</I>, <I>dash</I> and <I>ext</I> are both empty.  When <I>local</I>
          is <I>user</I><B>BREAK</B><I>anything</I>, <I>dash</I> is a hyphen and <I>ext</I> is <I>anything</I>.
          <I>user</I> may appear in any combination of uppercase and
          lowercase letters at the front of <I>local</I>.

          A catch-all user, <B>alias</B>, controls all other addresses.  In
          this case <I>ext</I> is <I>local</I> and <I>dash</I> is a hyphen.

          You can override all of <B>qmail-getpw</B>'s decisions with the
          <B>qmail-users</B> mechanism, which is reliable, highly
          configurable, and much faster than <B>qmail-getpw</B>.
