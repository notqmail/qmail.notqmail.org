          qmail-remote - send mail via SMTP

     <B>SYNOPSIS</B>
          <B>qmail-remote</B> <I>host</I> <I>sender</I> <I>recip</I> [ <I>recip</I> ... ]

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          <B>qmail-remote</B> reads a mail message from its input and sends
          the message to one or more recipients at a remote host.

          The remote host is <B>qmail-remote</B>'s first argument, <I>host</I>.
          <B>qmail-remote</B> sends the message to <I>host</I>, or to a mail
          exchanger for <I>host</I> listed in the Domain Name System, via the
          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  <I>host</I> can be either a
          fully-qualified domain name:

               silverton.berkeley.edu

          or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

               [128.32.183.163]

          The envelope recipient addresses are listed as <I>recip</I>
          arguments to <B>qmail-remote</B>.  The envelope sender address is
          listed as <I>sender</I>.

          Note that <B>qmail-remote</B> does not take options and does not
          follow the <B>getopt</B> standard.

     <B>TRANSPARENCY</B>
          End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.  A dot at the
          beginning of a line is encoded as dot dot.  It is impossible
          in SMTP to send a message that does not end with a newline.
          <B>qmail-remote</B> converts the UNIX newline convention into the
          SMTP newline convention by inserting CR before each LF.

          It is a violation of the SMTP protocol to send a message
          that contains long lines or non-ASCII characters.  However,
          <B>qmail-remote</B> will happily send such messages.  It is the
          user's responsibility to avoid generating illegal messages.

     <B>RESULTS</B>
          <B>qmail-remote</B> prints some number of <I>recipient</I> <I>reports</I>,
          followed by a <I>message</I> <I>report</I>. Each report is terminated by a
          0 byte.  Each report begins with a single letter:

          r    Recipient report: acceptance.

          h    Recipient report: permanent rejection.

          s    Recipient report: temporary rejection.

          K    Message report: success.  <I>host</I> has taken responsibility
               for delivering the message to each acceptable
               recipient.

          Z    Message report: temporary failure.

          D    Message report: permanent failure.

          After this letter comes a human-readable description of what
          happened.

          The recipient reports will always be printed in the same
          order as <B>qmail-remote</B>'s <I>recip</I> arguments.  Note that in
          failure cases there may be fewer recipient reports than
          <I>recip</I> arguments.

          <B>qmail-remote</B> always exits zero.

     <B>CONTROL</B> <B>FILES</B>
          <I>helohost</I>
               Current host name, for use solely in saying hello to
               the remote SMTP server.  Default:  <I>me</I>, if that is
               supplied; otherwise <B>qmail-remote</B> refuses to run.

          <I>smtproutes</I>
               Artificial SMTP routes.  Each route has the form
               <I>domain</I><B>:</B><I>relay</I>, without any extra spaces.  If <I>domain</I>
               matches <I>host</I>, <B>qmail-remote</B> will connect to <I>relay</I>, as if
               <I>host</I> had <I>relay</I> as its only MX.  (It will also avoid
               doing any CNAME lookups on <I>recip</I>.)  <I>host</I> may include a
               colon and a port number to use instead of the normal
               SMTP port, 25:

                  inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26

               <I>relay</I> may be empty; this tells <B>qmail-remote</B> to look up
               MX records as usual.  <I>smtproutes</I> may include wildcards:

                  .af.mil:
                  :heaven.af.mil

               Here any address ending with <B>.af.mil</B> (but not <B>af.mil</B>
               itself) is routed by its MX records; any other address
               is artificially routed to <B>heaven.af.mil</B>.

               The <B>qmail</B> system does not protect you if you create an
               artificial mail loop between machines.  However, you
               are always safe using <I>smtproutes</I> if you do not accept
               mail from the network.

          <I>timeoutconnect</I>
               Number of seconds <B>qmail-remote</B> will wait for the remote
               SMTP server to accept a connection.  Default: 60.  The
               kernel normally imposes a 75-second upper limit.

          <I>timeoutremote</I>
               Number of seconds <B>qmail-remote</B> will wait for each
               response from the remote SMTP server.  Default: 1200.
