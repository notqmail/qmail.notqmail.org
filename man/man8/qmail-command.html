     <B>NAME</B>
          qmail-command - user-specified mail delivery program

     <B>SYNOPSIS</B>
          in <B>.qmail</B><I>ext</I>:  <B>|</B><I>command</I>

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          <B>qmail-local</B> will, upon your request, feed each incoming mail
          message through a program of your choice.

          When a mail message arrives, <B>qmail-local</B> runs <B>sh</B> <B>-c</B> <I>command</I>
          in your home directory.  It makes the message available on
          <I>command</I>'s standard input.

          <B>WARNING:</B> The mail message does not begin with <B>qmail-local</B>'s
          usual <B>Return-Path</B> and <B>Delivered-To</B> lines.

          Note that <B>qmail-local</B> uses the same file descriptor for
          every delivery in your <B>.qmail</B> file, so it is not safe for
          <I>command</I> to fork a child that reads the message in the
          background while the parent exits.

     <B>EXIT</B> <B>CODES</B>
          <I>command</I>'s exit codes are interpreted as follows:  0 means
          that the delivery was successful; 99 means that the delivery
          was successful, but that <B>qmail-local</B> should ignore all
          further delivery instructions; 100 means that the delivery
          failed permanently (hard error); 111 means that the delivery
          failed but should be tried again in a little while (soft
          error).

          Currently 64, 65, 70, 76, 77, 78, and 112 are considered
          hard errors, and all other codes are considered soft errors,
          but <I>command</I> should avoid relying on this.

     <B>ENVIRONMENT</B> <B>VARIABLES</B>
          <B>qmail-local</B> supplies several useful environment variables to
          <I>command</I>.  <B>WARNING:</B> These environment variables are not
          quoted.  They may contain special characters.  They are
          under the control of a possibly malicious remote user.

          <B>SENDER</B> is the envelope sender address.  <B>NEWSENDER</B> is the
          forwarding envelope sender address, as described in <B>dot-</B>
          <B>qmail(5)</B>.  <B>RECIPIENT</B> is the envelope recipient address,
          <I>local</I>@<I>domain</I>.  <B>USER</B> is <I>user</I>.  <B>HOME</B> is your home directory,
          <I>homedir</I>.  <B>HOST</B> is the <I>domain</I> part of the recipient address.
          <B>LOCAL</B> is the <I>local</I> part.  <B>EXT</B> is the address extension, <I>ext</I>.

          <B>HOST2</B> is the portion of <B>HOST</B> preceding the last dot; <B>HOST3</B>
          is the portion of <B>HOST</B> preceding the second-to-last dot;
          <B>HOST4</B> is the portion of <B>HOST</B> preceding the third-to-last
          dot.
          <B>EXT2</B> is the portion of <B>EXT</B> following the first dash; <B>EXT3</B> is
          the portion following the second dash; <B>EXT4</B> is the portion
          following the third dash.  <B>DEFAULT</B> is the portion
          corresponding to the <B>default</B> part of the <B>.qmail-</B>...  file
          name; <B>DEFAULT</B> is not set if the file name does not end with
          <B>default</B>.

          <B>DTLINE</B> and <B>RPLINE</B> are the usual <B>Delivered-To</B> and <B>Return-Path</B>
          lines, including newlines.  <B>UFLINE</B> is the UUCP-style <B>From_</B>
          line that <B>qmail-local</B> adds to <I>mbox</I>-format files.
