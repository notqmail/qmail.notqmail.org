     <B>NAME</B>
          qmail-log - the qmail activity record

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> prints a series of lines describing its
          activities.  Each possible line is described below.

     <B>STATUS</B>
          <B>status:</B> <B>local</B> <I>l</I><B>/</B><I>L</I> <B>remote</B> <I>r</I><B>/</B><I>R</I> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is waiting for <I>l</I> local deliveries and <I>r</I>
               remote deliveries.  The concurrency limits are <I>L</I> and <I>R</I>.

          <B>status:</B> <B>exiting</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is done.

     <B>FATAL</B> <B>PROBLEMS</B>
          <B>alert:</B> <B>cannot</B> <B>start:</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to prepare itself for delivering
               messages; it is giving up.  This normally indicates a
               serious configuration error, but it can be caused by a
               temporary lack of resources.

          <B>alert:</B> <B>oh</B> <B>no!</B> <B>lost</B> <B>...</B>
               One of the other daemons has died.  <B>qmail-send</B> will
               exit as soon as possible.

     <B>SERIOUS</B> <B>PROBLEMS</B>
          <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>append</B> <B>to</B> <B>bounce</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to record a permanent failure,
               usually because the disk is full.  This is a very
               serious problem; <B>qmail-send</B> cannot proceed without
               recording the results.  It will try again in ten
               seconds.

          <B>alert:</B> <B>out</B> <B>of</B> <B>memory...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> tried to allocate more memory and failed.
               It will try again in ten seconds.

          <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>opendir...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is having trouble reading a file list from
               disk, usually because the system's file descriptor
               table is full, but possibly because permissions are set
               incorrectly.  It will try again in ten seconds.

          <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>switch</B> <B>back...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was sent SIGHUP, and it is unable to reenter
               the queue directory.  This is a very serious problem;
               <B>qmail-send</B> cannot proceed outside the queue directory.
               It will try again in ten seconds.

          <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>reread...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was sent SIGHUP, but it is unable to read
               the new controls.  It will continue operating with the
               original controls.

     <B>MESSAGES</B>
          <B>new</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is going to preprocess a queued message.
               The message number, <I>m</I>, is its disk inode number.  After
               a message is removed from the queue, its number can be
               reused immediately.

          <B>info</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I><B>:</B> <B>bytes</B> <I>b</I> <B>from</B>
               Message <I>m</I> contains <I>b</I> bytes; its envelope sender is <I>s</I>;
               it was queued by a user with user ID <I>u</I>.  <I>q</I> is a long-
               term queue identifier, the process ID of the <B>qmail-</B>
               <B>queue</B> that queued the message.

          <B>bounce</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I> <B>qp</B> <I>q</I>
               Message <I>m</I> had some delivery failures.  The long-term
               queue identifier of the bounce (or double-bounce)
               message is <I>q</I>.

          <B>triple</B> <B>bounce:</B> <B>discarding</B> <B>...</B>
               Message <I>m</I> had some delivery failures, but it is already
               a double-bounce message, so it must be thrown away.
               Triple-bounce messages do not exist.

          <B>end</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is about to remove message <I>m</I> from the queue.

     <B>DELIVERIES</B>
          <B>starting</B> <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I> <B>to</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is telling <B>qmail-lspawn</B> or <B>qmail-rspawn</B> to
               deliver message <I>m</I> to one recipient.  The delivery
               number, <I>d</I>, starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each new
               delivery.

          <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>success:</B> <B>...</B>
               Delivery <I>d</I> was successful.

          <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>failure:</B> <B>...</B>
               Delivery <I>d</I> failed permanently.  The message will
               bounce.

          <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>deferral:</B> <B>...</B>
               Delivery <I>d</I> failed temporarily.  This recipient will be
               retried later.

          <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>report</B> <B>mangled,</B> <B>will</B> <B>defer</B>
               There is a serious bug in <B>qmail-lspawn</B> or <B>qmail-rspawn</B>.
               This recipient will be retried later.

     <B>WARNINGS</B>
          <B>internal</B> <B>error:</B> <B>delivery</B> <B>report</B> <B>out</B> <B>of</B>
               <B>qmail-lspawn</B> or <B>qmail-rspawn</B> has supplied a report on a
               nonexistent delivery.  This is a serious bug.

          <B>qmail-clean</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>clean</B> <B>up</B> <B>...</B>
               For some reason <B>qmail-clean</B> is unable to remove the
               indicated file.  It will try again later.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>fsyncing</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was unable to write to disk the results of
               preprocessing a queued message.  It will try again
               later.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>in</B> <B>select</B>
               There is an operating system bug.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>injecting</B> <B>bounce</B> <B>message...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was unable to queue a bounce message,
               usually because the disk is full.  It will try again
               later.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>marking</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was unable to record the result of a
               successful or permanently unsuccessful delivery.  This
               means that the delivery will be tried again later.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>opening</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was unable to open the list of local or
               remote recipients for a message.  It will try again
               later.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>reading</B> <B>...</B>
               Either <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to read a recipient list,
               or it is unable to read the envelope of a queued
               message, or it is out of memory.  Whatever it was
               doing, it will try again later.

          <B>trouble</B> <B>writing</B> <B>to</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was unable to preprocess a queued message,
               usually because the disk is full.  It will try again
               later.

          <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>create</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> was unable to preprocess a queued message,
               usually because the disk is out of inodes.  It will try
               again later.

          <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>open</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to read the envelope of a queued
               message for preprocessing.  It will try again later.

          <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>start</B> <B>qmail-queue...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to queue a bounce message, usually
               because the machine is almost out of memory.  It will
               try again later.

          <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>stat</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to obtain information about a file
               that should exist.  It will try again later.

          <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>unlink</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to remove a file.  It will try
               again later.

          <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>utime</B> <B>...</B>
               <B>qmail-send</B> is about to exit, and it is unable to record
               on disk the next scheduled delivery time for a message.
               The message will be retried as soon as <B>qmail-send</B> is
               restarted.

          <B>unknown</B> <B>record</B> <B>type</B> <B>in</B> <B>...</B>
               There is a serious bug in either <B>qmail-queue</B> or <B>qmail-</B>
               <B>send</B>.
