     <B>NAME</B>
          envelopes - sender/recipient lists attached to messages

     <B>INTRODUCTION</B>
          Electronic mail messages are delivered in <I>envelopes</I>.

          An envelope lists a <I>sender</I> and one or more <I>recipients</I>.
          Usually these envelope addresses are the same as the
          addresses listed in the message header:

             (envelope) from djb to root
             From: djb
             To: root

          In more complicated situations, though, the envelope
          addresses may differ from the header addresses.

     <B>ENVELOPE</B> <B>EXAMPLES</B>
          When a message is delivered to several people at different
          locations, it is first photocopied and placed into several
          envelopes:

             (envelope) from djb to root
             From: djb                          Copy #1 of message
             To: root, god@brl.mil

             (envelope) from djb to god@brl.mil
             From: djb                          Copy #2 of message
             To: root, god@brl.mil

          When a message is delivered to several people at the same
          location, the sender doesn't have to photocopy it.  He can
          instead stuff it into one envelope with several addresses;
          the recipients will make the photocopy:

             (envelope) from djb to god@brl.mil, angel@brl.mil
             From: djb
             To: god@brl.mil, angel@brl.mil, joe, frde

          Bounced mail is sent back to the envelope sender address.
          The bounced mail doesn't list an envelope sender, so bounce
          loops are impossible:

             (envelope) from &lt;&gt; to djb
             From: MAILER-DAEMON
             To: djb
             Subject: unknown user frde

          The recipient of a message may make another copy and forward
          it in a new envelope:

             (envelope) from djb to joe
             From: djb                          Original message
             To: joe

             (envelope) from joe to fred
             From: djb                          Forwarded message
             To: joe

          A mailing list works almost the same way:

             (envelope) from djb to sos-list
             From: djb                          Original message
             To: sos-list

             (envelope) from sos-owner to god@brl.mil
             From: djb                          Forwarded message
             To: sos-list                       to recipient #1

             (envelope) from sos-owner to frde
             From: djb                          Forwarded message
             To: sos-list                       to recipient #2

          Notice that the mailing list is set up to replace the
          envelope sender with something new, <B>sos-owner</B>.  So bounces
          will come back to <B>sos-owner</B>:

             (envelope) from &lt;&gt; to sos-owner
             From: MAILER-DAEMON
             To: sos-owner
             Subject: unknown user frde

          It's a good idea to set up an extra address, <B>sos-owner</B>, like
          this:  the original envelope sender (<B>djb</B>) has no way to fix
          bad <B>sos-list</B> addresses, and of course bounces must not be
          sent to <B>sos-list</B> itself.

     <B>HOW</B> <B>ENVELOPE</B> <B>ADDRESSES</B> <B>ARE</B> <B>STORED</B>
          Envelope sender and envelope recipient addresses are
          transmitted and recorded in several ways.

          When a user injects mail through <B>qmail-inject</B>, he can supply
          a <B>Return-Path</B> line or a <B>-f</B> option for the envelope sender;
          by default the envelope sender is his login name.  The
          envelope recipient addresses can be taken from the command
          line or from various header fields, depending on the options
          to <B>qmail-inject</B>.  Similar comments apply to <B>sendmail</B>.

          When a message is transferred from one machine to another
          through SMTP, the envelope sender is given in a <B>MAIL</B> <B>FROM</B>
          command, the envelope recipients are given in <B>RCPT</B> <B>TO</B>
          commands, and the message is supplied separately by a <B>DATA</B>
          command.

          When a message is delivered by <B>qmail</B> to a single local
          recipient, <B>qmail-local</B> records the recipient in <B>Delivered-To</B>
          and the envelope sender in <B>Return-Path</B>.  It uses <B>Delivered-</B>
          <B>To</B> to detect mail forwarding loops.

          <B>sendmail</B> normally records the envelope sender in <B>Return-</B>
          <B>Path</B>.  It does not record envelope recipient addresses, on
          the theory that they are redundant:  you received the mail,
          so you must have been one of the envelope recipients.

          Note that, if the header doesn't have any recipient
          addresses, <B>sendmail</B> will move envelope recipient addresses
          back into the header.  This situation occurs if all
          addresses were originally listed as <B>Bcc</B>, since <B>Bcc</B> is
          automatically removed.  When <B>sendmail</B> sees this, it creates
          a new <B>Apparently-To</B> header field with the envelope recipient
          addresses.  This has the strange effect that each blind-
          carbon-copy recipient will see a list of all recipients on
          the same machine.

          When a message is stored in <B>mbox</B> format, the envelope sender
          is recorded at the top of the message as a UUCP-style <B>From</B>
          (no colon) line.  Note that this line is less reliable than
          the <B>Return-Path</B> line added by <B>qmail-local</B> or <B>sendmail</B>.
