          dot-qmail - control the delivery of mail messages

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          Normally the <B>qmail-local</B> program delivers each incoming
          message to your system mailbox, <I>homedir</I><B>/Mailbox</B>, where
          <I>homedir</I> is your home directory.

          It can instead write the mail to a different file or
          directory, forward it to another address, distribute it to a
          mailing list, or even execute programs, all under your
          control.

     <B>THE</B> <B>QMAIL</B> <B>FILE</B>
          To change <B>qmail-local</B>'s behavior, set up a <B>.qmail</B> file in
          your home directory.

          <B>.qmail</B> contains one or more lines.  Each line is a delivery
          instruction.  <B>qmail-local</B> follows each instruction in turn.
          There are five types of delivery instructions:  (1) comment;
          (2) program; (3) forward; (4) mbox; (5) maildir.

          (1)  A comment line begins with a number sign:

                    # this is a comment

               <B>qmail-local</B> ignores the line.

          (2)  A program line begins with a vertical bar:

                    |preline /usr/ucb/vacation djb

               <B>qmail-local</B> takes the rest of the line as a command to
               supply to <B>sh</B>.  See <B>qmail-command(8)</B> for further
               information.

          (3)  A forward line begins with an ampersand:

                    &amp;me@new.job.com

               <B>qmail-local</B> takes the rest of the line as a mail
               address; it uses <B>qmail-queue</B> to forward the message to
               that address.  The address must contain a fully
               qualified domain name; it must not contain extra
               spaces, angle brackets, or comments:

                    # the following examples are WRONG
                    &amp;me@new
                    &amp;&lt;me@new.job.com&gt;
                    &amp; me@new.job.com
                    &amp;me@new.job.com (New Address)

               If the address begins with a letter or number, you may
               leave out the ampersand:

                    me@new.job.com

               Note that <B>qmail-local</B> omits its new <B>Return-Path</B> line
               when forwarding messages.

          (4)  An <I>mbox</I> line begins with a slash or dot, and does not
               end with a slash:

                    /home/djb/Mailbox.sos

               <B>qmail-local</B> takes the entire line as a filename.  It
               appends the mail message to that file, using <B>flock</B>-
               style file locking if possible.  <B>qmail-local</B> stores the
               mail message in <I>mbox</I> format, as described in <B>mbox(5)</B>.

               <B>WARNING:</B> On many systems, anyone who can read a file
               can <B>flock</B> it, and thus hold up <B>qmail-local</B>'s delivery
               forever.  Do not deliver mail to a publicly accessible
               file!

               If <B>qmail-local</B> is able to lock the file, but has
               trouble writing to it (because, for example, the disk
               is full), it will truncate the file back to its
               original length.  However, it cannot prevent mailbox
               corruption if the system crashes during delivery.

          (5)  A <I>maildir</I> line begins with a slash or dot, and ends
               with a slash:

                    /home/djb/Maildir/

               <B>qmail-local</B> takes the entire line as the name of a
               directory in <I>maildir</I> format.  It reliably stores the
               incoming message in that directory.  See <B>maildir(5)</B> for
               more details.

          If <B>.qmail</B> has the execute bit set, it must not contain any
          program lines, <I>mbox</I> lines, or <I>maildir</I> lines.  If <B>qmail-local</B>
          sees any such lines, it will stop and indicate a temporary
          failure.

          If <B>.qmail</B> is completely empty (0 bytes long), or does not
          exist, <B>qmail-local</B> follows the <I>defaultdelivery</I> instructions
          set by your system administrator; normally <I>defaultdelivery</I>
          is <B>./Mailbox</B>, so <B>qmail-local</B> appends the mail message to
          <B>Mailbox</B> in <I>mbox</I> format.

          <B>.qmail</B> may contain extra spaces and tabs at the end of a
          line.  Blank lines are allowed, but not for the first line
          of <B>.qmail</B>.

          If <B>.qmail</B> is world-writable or group-writable, <B>qmail-local</B>
          stops and indicates a temporary failure.

     <B>SAFE</B> <B>QMAIL</B> <B>EDITING</B>
          Incoming messages can arrive at any moment.  If you want to
          safely edit your <B>.qmail</B> file, first set the sticky bit on
          your home directory:

               chmod +t $HOME

          <B>qmail-local</B> will temporarily defer delivery of any message
          to you if your home directory is sticky (or group-writable
          or other-writable, which should never happen).  Make sure to

               chmod -t $HOME

          when you are done!  It's a good idea to test your new <B>.qmail</B>
          file as follows:

               qmail-local -n $USER ~ $USER '' '' '' '' ./Mailbox

     <B>EXTENSION</B> <B>ADDRESSES</B>
          In the <B>qmail</B> system, you control all local addresses of the
          form <I>user</I><B>-</B><I>anything</I>, as well as the address <I>user</I> itself,
          where <I>user</I> is your account name.  Delivery to <I>user</I><B>-</B><I>anything</I>
          is controlled by the file <I>homedir</I>/<B>.qmail-</B><I>anything</I>.  (These
          rules may be changed by the system administrator; see
          <B><A HREF="../man5/qmail-users.html">qmail-users(5)</A></B>.)

          The <B>alias</B> user controls all other addresses.  Delivery to
          <I>local</I> is controlled by the file <I>homedir</I>/<B>.qmail-</B><I>local</I>, where
          <I>homedir</I> is <B>alias</B>'s home directory.

          In the following description, <B>qmail-local</B> is handling a
          message addressed to <I>local</I>@<I>domain</I>, where <I>local</I> is controlled
          by <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I>.  Here is what it does.

          If <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I> is completely empty, <B>qmail-local</B> follows the
          <I>defaultdelivery</I> instructions set by your system
          administrator.

          If <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I> doesn't exist, <B>qmail-local</B> will try some
          default <B>.qmail</B> files.  For example, if <I>ext</I> is <B>foo-bar</B>,
          <B>qmail-local</B> will try first <B>.qmail-foo-bar</B>, then <B>.qmail-foo-</B>
          <B>default</B>, and finally <B>.qmail-default</B>.  If none of these
          exist, <B>qmail-local</B> will bounce the message.  (Exception: for
          the basic <I>user</I> address, <B>qmail-local</B> treats a nonexistent
          <B>.qmail</B> the same as an empty <B>.qmail</B>.)

          <B>WARNING:</B> For security, <B>qmail-local</B> replaces any dots in <I>ext</I>
          with colons before checking <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I>.  For convenience,
          <B>qmail-local</B> converts any uppercase letters in <I>ext</I> to
          lowercase.

          When <B>qmail-local</B> forwards a message as instructed in
          <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I> (or <B>.qmail-default</B>), it checks whether
          <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I><B>-owner</B> exists.  If so, it uses <I>local</I><B>-owner@</B><I>domain</I>
          as the envelope sender for the forwarded message.  Otherwise
          it retains the envelope sender of the original message.
          Exception:  <B>qmail-local</B> always retains the original envelope
          sender if it is the empty address or <B>#@[]</B>, i.e., if this is
          a bounce message.

          <B>qmail-local</B> also supports <B>variable</B> <B>envelope</B> <B>return</B> <B>paths</B>
          (VERPs):  if <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I><B>-owner</B> and <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I><B>-owner-default</B>
          both exist, it uses <I>local</I><B>-owner-@</B><I>domain</I><B>-@[]</B> as the envelope
          sender.  This will cause a recipient <I>recip</I><B>@</B><I>reciphost</I> to see
          an envelope sender of <I>local</I><B>-owner-</B><I>recip</I><B>=</B><I>reciphost</I><B>@</B><I>domain</I>.

     <B>ERROR</B> <B>HANDLING</B>
          If a delivery instruction fails, <B>qmail-local</B> stops
          immediately and reports failure.  <B>qmail-local</B> handles
          forwarding after all other instructions, so any error in
          another type of delivery will prevent all forwarding.

          If a program returns exit code 99, <B>qmail-local</B> ignores all
          succeeding lines in <B>.qmail</B>, but it still pays attention to
          previous forward lines.

          To set up independent instructions, where a temporary or
          permanent failure in one instruction does not affect the
          others, move each instruction into a separate <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I>
          file, and set up a central <B>.qmail</B> file that forwards to all
          of the <B>.qmail-</B><I>ext</I>s.  Note that <B>qmail-local</B> can handle any
          number of forward lines simultaneously.
