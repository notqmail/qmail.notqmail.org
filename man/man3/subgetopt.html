          int <B>sgoptind</B>;

          int <B>sgoptdone</B>;
          int <B>sgoptproblem</B>;

          int <B>sgopt(</B><I>argc</I>,<I>argv</I>,<I>opts</I><B>)</B>;

          int <I>argc</I>;
          char **<I>argv</I>;
          char *<I>opts</I>;

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
          <B>sgopt</B> returns the next valid command-line option character
          from <I>argv</I>.

          Valid option characters are listed in the <I>opts</I> string.  <I>opts</I>
          may be empty.  A character in <I>opts</I> may be followed by a
          colon, in which case it takes an <I>option</I> <I>argument</I>. Avoid
          using the characters ?, :, and - as option characters.

          Below <I>option</I> <I>argument</I> is abbreviated as <I>optarg</I> and <I>command</I>-
          <I>line</I> <I>argument</I> is abbreviated as <I>cmdarg</I>.

          Options are listed in cmdargs which begin with a minus sign.
          Several options which do not take optargs may be combined
          into one cmdarg.

          An option which takes an optarg may be handled in two ways.
          If it appears at the very end of a cmdarg, then the entire
          next cmdarg is the optarg.  But if there are any characters
          in the cmdarg after the option character, then those
          characters form the optarg.  The optarg is returned in
          <B>sgoptarg</B>.  Next time <B>sgopt</B> looks at the cmdarg which follows
          the optarg.

          If a cmdarg does not begin with a hyphen, or if it is a lone
          hyphen not followed by any characters, or if it begins with
          two hyphens, then it terminates option processing, and <B>sgopt</B>
          returns an appropriate code.  If there are two hyphens,
          <B>sgopt</B> will advance attention to the next cmdarg, so it can
          be called again to read further options.

     <B>PROPER</B> <B>USAGE</B>
          <B>sgoptproblem</B> should be used only when <B>sgopt</B> returns ?.
          <B>sgoptind</B> and <B>sgoptpos</B> are defined all the time.  <B>sgoptarg</B> is
          defined all the time; it is null unless <B>sgopt</B> has just
          returned an option with optarg.

          <B>sgopt</B> is typically used as follows.

          #include &lt;subgetopt.h&gt;

          main(argc,argv) int argc; char **argv; { int opt;

          while ((opt = sgopt(argc,argv,"a:s")) != sgoptdone)
            switch(opt) {
              case 'a':
                printf("opt a with optarg %s\n",sgoptarg); break;
              case 's':
                printf("opt s with no optarg\n"); break;
              case '?':
                if (argv[sgoptind] &amp;&amp; (sgoptind &lt; argc))
                  printf("illegal opt %c\n",sgoptproblem);
                else
                  printf("missing arg, opt %c\n",sgoptproblem);
                <B><A HREF="https://qmail.mirrors.auchnet.org/man/man1/exit.html">exit(1)</A></B>;
            }

          argv += sgoptind;
          while (*argv) printf("argument %s\n",*argv++);
          <B><A HREF="https://qmail.mirrors.auchnet.org/man/man0/exit.html">exit(0)</A></B>;
          }

          The end of the command line is marked by either <I>argc</I>, or a
          null pointer in <I>argv</I>, whichever comes first.  Normally these
          two markers coincide, so it is redundant to test for both
          <I>argv</I><B>[sgoptind]</B> and <B>sgoptind</B> <B>&lt;</B> <I>argc</I>. The above code shows
          both tests as an illustration.

          <B>Multiple</B> <B>option</B> <B>sets:</B> One useful technique is to call <B>sgopt</B>
          with a primary <I>opts</I> until it returns EOF, then call <B>sgopt</B>
          with a secondary <I>opts</I> until it returns EOF.  The user can
          provide primary options, then a double hyphen, and then
          secondary options.  No special handling is needed if some or
          all of the options are omitted.  The same technique can be
          used for any number of option sets in series.

          <B>Multiple</B> <B>command</B> <B>lines:</B> Before parsing a new <B>argv</B>, make sure
          to set <B>sgoptind</B> and <B>sgoptpos</B> back to 1 and 0.

     <B>PARSING</B> <B>STAGES</B>
          <B>sgopt</B> keeps track of its position in <I>argv</I> with <B>sgoptind</B> and
          <B>sgoptpos</B>, which are initialized to 1 and 0.  It looks at
          <I>argv</I><B>[sgoptind][sgoptpos]</B> and following characters.

          <B>sgopt</B> indicates that no more options are available by
          returning <B>sgoptdone</B>, which is initialized to <B>SUBGETOPTDONE</B>,
          which is defined as -1.

          <B>sgopt</B> begins by setting <B>optarg</B> to null.

          <B>Ending</B> <B>conditions:</B> If <I>argv</I> is null, or <B>sgoptind</B> is larger
          than <I>argc</I>, or the current cmdarg <I>argv</I><B>[sgoptind]</B> is null,
          then <B>sgopt</B> returns <B>optdone</B>.

          <B>Stage</B> <B>one:</B> If the current character is zero, <B>sgopt</B> moves to
          the beginning of the next cmdarg.  It then checks the ending
          conditions again.

          <B>Stage</B> <B>two:</B> If the current position is the begining of the
          cmdarg, <B>sgopt</B> checks whether the current character is a
          minus sign.  If not it returns <B>optdone</B>.  It then moves to
          the next character.  If that character is zero, <B>sgopt</B> moves
          back to the beginning of the cmdarg, and returns <B>sgoptdone</B>.
          If the character is a minus sign, <B>sgopt</B> moves to the
          beginning of the next cmdarg, and returns <B>sgoptdone</B>.

          <B>Stage</B> <B>three:</B> <B>sgopt</B> records the current character, <I>c</I>, and
          moves to the next character.  There are three possibilities:
          (1) <I>c</I> is an option character without optarg in <I>opts</I>, or (2)
          <I>c</I> is an option character with optarg in <I>opts</I>, or (3) <I>c</I> does
          not appear in <I>opts</I>.

          (1) If <I>c</I> appears as an option character without optarg in
          <I>opts</I>, <B>sgopt</B> returns <I>c</I>.

          (2) If <I>c</I> appears as an option character with optarg in <I>opts</I>,
          <B>sgopt</B> sets <B>sgoptarg</B> to the current position, and moves to
          the next cmdarg.  If <B>sgoptarg</B> is nonempty, <B>sgopt</B> returns <I>c</I>.

          Then <B>sgopt</B> sets <B>sgoptarg</B> to the current cmdarg.  If the
          current cmdarg is null, or past <I>argc</I>, <B>sgopt</B> sets
          <B>sgoptproblem</B> to <I>c</I> and returns ?.  Otherwise <B>sgopt</B> moves to
          the next argument and returns <I>c</I>.

          (2) If <I>c</I> does not appear in <I>opts</I>, <B>sgopt</B> sets <B>sgoptproblem</B> to
          <I>c</I> and returns ?.

     <B>SYNTAX</B> <B>NOTE</B>
          <B>sgopt</B> is actually a macro abbreviation for <B>subgetopt</B>.  The
          external <B>sg</B> variables are also macros for <B>subget</B>.  These
          macros are defined in <B>&lt;subgetopt.h&gt;</B>, unless <B>SUBGETOPTNOSHORT</B>
          is defined when <B>&lt;subgetopt.h&gt;</B> is included.

     <B>VERSION</B>
          subgetopt version 0.9, 931129.
