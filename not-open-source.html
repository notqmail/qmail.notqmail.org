<h1>qmail is now open source</h1>

<p>In case you're wondering, qmail is now open source, and qualifies
for use of the <a href="http://opensource.org">OSI-Certified</a>
trademark.  Other programs which Dan Bernstein licenses similarly,
including djbdns, ucspi-tcp, and daemontools, are <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html">also open source</a>.  For a
program to be "open source", you must be able to, among other things,
<a href="http://opensource.org/docs/definition.html#4">change the
source and redistribute it</a>.  DJB used to prohibit distribution of
modified code.  DJB has promised that all his code will be placed into
the public domain.  Public domain code is unlicensed, and it qualifies
for use of the OSI-certified trademark.</p>
