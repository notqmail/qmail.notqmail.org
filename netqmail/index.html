<p>A motley krewe of qmail contributors (see the README) has 
put together a netqmail-1.06 distribution of qmail.  It is derived from
Daniel Bernstein's qmail-1.03 plus bug fixes, a few feature enhancements,
and some documentation.</p>

<p>We have done this because in our opinion, too many new users are
confused by the out-of-date INSTALL file, and too much time is spent
arguing on the mailing list over bugs.  We have tried to stick to the
barest minimum number of <a href="CHANGES.html">changes</a>.  We have fixed
only those things which are out-and-out wrong, or which have been
approved by djb (specifically QMAILQUEUE).</p>

<p>You can <a href="../netqmail-1.06.tar.gz">download</a> netqmail
1.06.  The MD5SUM for this file is c922f776140b2c83043a6195901c67d3.
Older issues are still <a href="archives.html">available</a>.

<p>Bill Shupp has put together a <a
href="http://shupp.org/smtp-auth-tls/">TLS + SMTP Auth patch</a>
specifically for netqmail-1.05 (should work fine for netqmail-1.06).  Ted Fines has a <a
href="https://qmail.mirrors.auchnet.org/netqmail/www.apecity.com/qmail/patches.html">patch which
combines</a> this with <a href="../top.html#200401280">viruscan</a>.</p>
