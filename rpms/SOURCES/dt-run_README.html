This is alpha software, so be gentle with it!

This package's main purpose is to give you tools to run services under
svscan controlled supervises in a sysV like init environment.  In
particular, the package

-- Sets up dt-svscan.init which starts/stops svscan and the supervises
   under svscan's control.

-- Sets up dt-runlevel.init which manages all the runlevel changes for
   the services running under svscan.  

In fact, dt-svscan.init and dt-runlevel.init provide an environment that
functions on its own.  This means that once dt-svscan.init started
svscan, just given the runlevel to change to, dt-runlevel.init decides
which services to stop/start, and in which order.

The order in which services are started/stopped are set up by the
administrator using the runlevelconf package.

Since setting up daemons to run under svscan requires to set up run
scripts and links in svscan's service directory, the package provides
run files for a large number of services (including all the qmail
daemons), and two scripts, add-service.sh and remove-service.sh.  

To see how things would approximately work, it is probably best to
give an example (the detailed installation notes are in INSTALL, and
the detailed description of how things work is in MANUAL).  

Suppose you would like to set up qmail, qmail-smtpd and dnscache to
run under svscan.

First, you install the basic dt-run files along with qmail's run files:

make ibase iqmail

After this, you will make appropriate entries in /etc/inittab that
would run dt-svscan.init and dt-runlevel.init.

The qmail daemons's run files are put under /var/service.  For
example, for qmail-smtpd, you will have

/var/service/qmail-smtpd/run
/var/service/qmail-smtpd/log/run
/var/service/qmail-smtpd/log/main/

Next you set up the run files for dnscache by running

dnscache-conf dnscache dtlog /var/service/dnscache

Then you run 

add-service.sh qmail qmail-smtpd dnscache

The three main things the add-service.sh script does are:

First, it sets up the programs (in fact, they are just
links to a "meta" init file) qmail.init, qmail-smtpd.init
and dnscache.init in /usr/local/sbin.  You can use these programs to
manually start/stop and signal the services---as you used to do with
init scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d/. So you can do

qmail.init reload 

to let qmail-send know about your new virtualdomain.

Second, add-service.sh lets runlevelconf know at which runlevels the
services should be started/stopped.

Finally, add-service.sh sets up the links in svscan's directory,
/service, to /var/service/{qmail,qmail-smtpd,dnscache}.  The script
add-service.sh makes sure that these services get started in the
current runlevel only if they are supposed to run.
 
If you decide to use rblsmtpd instead of bare qmail-smtpd, you can
just do

remove-service.sh qmail-smtpd
add-service.sh rblsmtpd

In the MANUAL file, you can read about how to tell add-service.sh at
which runlevels you want a particular service to be run, and in what
order the services should be started.  You can also add a service to
the list of services add-service.sh knows about.

Besides the qmail run files, if you do

make iother

run scripts for many common services are installed, such as
for telnetd, rlogind, wuftpd, proftpd, rsync.
