Run

rpmbuild --rebuild qmail-1.03-112patch_14_15.src.rpm

This edits the qmail binaries for the qmail uids/gids in your system
(or adds the qmail users/groups if they do not yet exist), and creates
the binary rpm you want to install on your system; the name of this
binary rpm is

qmail-1.03-112patch_14_15.i386.rpm

and you install it with

rpm -Uvh qmail-1.03-110patch_14_15.i386.rpm

This binary rpm is usually not suitable to install on other machines
since the qmail uids might be different from your system's.  

So if you have a bunch of, say, FC 2 Linux boxes, then on each you
would have to build the i386.rpm as above, but if the qmail users are
the same on each box as on the build box, then you can install
qmail-1.03-112patch_14_15.i386.rpm directly.
