<h2>Standard packages</h2>

<h3>Download</h3>

<ul>

<li>To get the latest rpm containing the qmail binaries, click <a
href="SRPMS/qmail-1.03-112patch_14_15.src.rpm">here.</a> Note that
this is an src.rpm file because the final binary rpm has to be made on
the install system.  Still, I refer to this rpm as "binary" rpm.

<li> To get the latest source rpm, click <a
href="SRPMS/var-qmail-create-1.03-112patch_14_15.src.rpm">here.</a>

<li> To get the latest spec file, click <a
href="SPECS/var-qmail-create_14_15.spec.html">here.</a>

</ul>


<h3>Install</h3>

Please really read the installation instructions since the qmail rpm
does not install as other rpms due to the requirement that the qmail
uids are to be added to the binaries on the system where it gets
installed.

<ul>

<li> For installation instructions for the "binary" rpm, click <a
href="SRPMS/qmail-1.03-112_README.html">here</a>.  The binary rpm was made
on a Fedora Core 2 system, and if you have a different system, you may
have to install from the source rpm.

<li> For installation instructions from the source rpm, click <a
href="SRPMS/var-qmail-create-1.03-112_README.html">here</a>.

</ul>

If you want to run qmail under <tt>daemontools</tt>, the packages
listed <a href="run.html">here</a> may help.


<h2>Patched packages</h2>

I have made a kit called <tt>var-qmail-create</tt> which can create an
rpm that applies a configurable set of patches to qmail.  You can read
about the package <a
href="tools/var-qmail-create-1.03-112_README.html">here</a> and download
the package <a href="tools/var-qmail-create-1.03-112.tar.gz">here</a>.
