Subject: Stunnel tip for qmail-{pop3d,smtpd}-ssl

After searching for a way to easily bring up SSL-enabled versions of 
these services without messing up my existing means of configuration 
too much, I came upon a rather simple solution for stunnel (which 
seems to give people fits sometimes). Simply create a wrapper script 
named qmail-stunnel-wrapper.sh like so:

--- snip ---
#!/bin/ash

SSLCERT=$1; shift

exec /usr/sbin/stunnel -fd 3 3<<HERE
debug=4
foreground=yes
cert=$SSLCERT
exec=$1
execargs=$*
HERE
--- snip ---

...and you can call it from within your 
supervise/qmail-{pop3d,smtpd}-ssl/run command line:

exec /usr/local/sbin/softlimit -m 20971520 /usr/local/sbin/tcpserver \
         -v -x /etc/tcprules.d/qmail-pop3d.cdb -c 120 -R 0 995 \
         /var/qmail/bin/qmail-stunnel-wrapper.sh \
         /var/qmail/control/pop3d-ssl.pem \
         /var/qmail/bin/qmail-popup "`cat /var/qmail/control/me`" \
         /usr/sbin/vchkpw \
         /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d-wrapper.sh \
         /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d Maildir 2>&1 7>&1


This way you can keep your existing configuration in the same 
exec-pipeline method of the run files -- like the qmail-pop3d-wrapper 
and FD7 redirect -- without having to make a separate stunnel config 
file for each SSL service. Plus your qmail-smtpd-ssl service can be 
run using the same wrapper.

Note that you need stunnel v4.05 or higher for this to work.


Hope this is useful for someone!
