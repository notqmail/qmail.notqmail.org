# invoke this program instead of qmail-pop3d.
# if the user has a Maildir called Maildirdummy, then this script will
#   deliver their mail to the smtp server on the same machine that
#   is running the pop client.  While it's running, the pop client will
#   get handed an empty Maildir to play with.
# care should be taken not to check the pop mail so often that you
#   get two maildir2smtp invocations running at the same time.
# Inspired by a similar program written by Anand <arb-qmail@iconnect.co.ke>.
# Brad Clements suggested that qmail-pop3d should be executed 'else'.
