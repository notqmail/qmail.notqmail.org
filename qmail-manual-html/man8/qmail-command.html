<B>NAME</B>
     qmail-command - user-specified mail delivery program

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     in <B>.qmail</B><I>ext</I>:  <B>|</B><I>command</I>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B><A HREF="qmail-local.html">qmail-local</A></B> will, upon your request, feed each incoming mail
     message through a program of your choice.

     When a mail message arrives, <B>qmail-local</B> runs <B>sh</B> <B>-c</B>  <I>command</I>
     in  your  home directory.  It makes the message available on
     <I>command</I>'s standard input.

     <B>WARNING:</B> The mail message does not begin with  <B>qmail-local</B>'s
     usual <B>Return-Path</B> and <B>Delivered-To</B> lines.

     Note that <B>qmail-local</B> uses  the  same  file  descriptor  for
     every  delivery  in  your <B>.qmail</B> file, so it is not safe for
     <I>command</I> to fork a child that reads the message in the  back-
     ground while the parent exits.

     <I>command</I>'s exit codes are interpreted as  follows:   0  means
     that the delivery was successful; 99 means that the delivery
     was successful,  but  that  <B>qmail-local</B>  should  ignore  all
     further  delivery  instructions; 100 means that the delivery
     failed permanently (hard <A HREF="../man3/error.html">error</A>); 111 means that the delivery
     failed  but  should  be  tried again in a little while (soft
     error).  Currently 64, 65, 70, 76, 77, 78, and 112 are  con-
     sidered hard errors, and all other codes are considered soft
     errors, but <I>command</I> should avoid relying on this.

     <B>qmail-local</B> supplies several useful environment variables to
     <I>command</I>.   <B>SENDER</B> is the envelope sender address.  <B>NEWSENDER</B>
     is the forwarding envelope sender address, as  described  in
     <B>dot-qmail(5)</B>.   <B>RECIPIENT</B> is the envelope recipient address,
     <I>local</I>@<I>domain</I>.  <B>USER</B> is <I>user</I>.  <B>HOME</B> is your  home  directory,
     <I>homedir</I>.   <B>HOST</B> is the <I>domain</I> part of the recipient address.
     <B>LOCAL</B> is the <I>local</I> part.  <B>EXT</B> is the <B>.qmail</B> extension,  <I>ext</I>.
     <B>EXT2</B> is the portion of <B>EXT</B> following the first dash; <B>EXT3</B> is
     the portion following the second dash; <B>EXT4</B> is  the  portion
     following  the  third dash.  <B>DTLINE</B> and <B>RPLINE</B> are the usual
     <B>Delivered-To</B>  and  <B>Return-Path</B>  lines,  including  newlines.
     <B>UFLINE</B> is the UUCP-style <B>From_</B> line that <B>qmail-local</B> adds to
     <I><A HREF="../man5/mbox.html">mbox</A></I>-format files.

     <B>WARNING:</B> These environment variables are not  quoted.   They
     may  contain special characters.  They are under the control
     of a possibly malicious remote user.
