<B>NAME</B>
     qmail-queue - queue a mail message for delivery

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>qmail-queue</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>qmail-queue</B> reads a mail message from descriptor 0.  It then
     reads envelope information from descriptor 1.  It places the
     message into the  outgoing  queue  for  future  delivery  by
     <B><A HREF="qmail-send.html">qmail-send</A></B>.

     The envelope information is an envelope sender address  fol-
     lowed by a list of envelope recipient addresses.  The sender
     address is preceded by the letter F and terminated  by  a  0
     byte.   Each  recipient  address is preceded by the letter T
     and terminated by a 0 byte.  The list of recipient <A HREF="../man5/addresses.html">addresses</A>
     is  terminated by an extra 0 byte.  If <B>qmail-queue</B> sees end-
     of-file before the extra 0 byte, it aborts  without  placing
     the message into the queue.

     Every envelope recipient address must contain a username, an
     @ sign, and a fully qualified domain name.

     <B>qmail-queue</B> always adds a <B>Received</B> line to the  top  of  the
     message.   Other than this, <B>qmail-queue</B> does not inspect the
     message and does not enforce any restrictions  on  its  con-
     tents.   However,  the  recipients  probably expect to see a
     proper header, as described in <B><A HREF="../man5/qmail-header.html">qmail-header</A>(5)</B>.

<B>EXIT</B> <B>CODES</B>
     0  if  <B>qmail-queue</B>  has  successfully  queued  the  message,
     nonzero  if  <B>qmail-queue</B>  has  failed  to queue the message.
     <B>qmail-queue</B> does not print diagnostics.
