<B>NAME</B>
     mbox - file containing mail messages

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
     The most common format for storage of mail messages is  <I>mbox</I>
     format.   An  <I>mbox</I>  is a single file containing zero or more
     mail messages.

<B>MESSAGE</B> <B>FORMAT</B>
     A message encoded in <I>mbox</I> format begins with a  <B>From_</B>  line,
     continues  with a series of non-<B>From_</B> lines, and ends with a
     blank line.  A <B>From_</B> line means any line  that  begins  with
     the characters F, r, o, m, space:

          Return-Path: &lt;god@heaven.af.mil&gt;
          Delivered-To: djb@silverton.berkeley.edu
          Date: 3 Jan 1996 01:05:34 -0000
          From: God &lt;god@heaven.af.mil&gt;
          To: djb@silverton.berkeley.edu (D. J. Bernstein)

          How's that mail system project coming along?


     The final line is a completely  blank  line  (no  spaces  or
     tabs).  Notice that blank lines may also appear elsewhere in
     the message.

     The  <B>From_</B>  line  always  looks  like  <B>From</B>  <I>envsender</I>  <I>date</I>
     <I>moreinfo</I>.  <I>envsender</I> is one word, without spaces or tabs; it
     is usually the envelope sender of the message.  <I>date</I> is  the
     delivery date of the message.  It always contains exactly 24
     characters in <B>asctime</B> format.  <I>moreinfo</I> is optional; it  may
     contain arbitrary information.

     Between the <B>From_</B> line and the blank line is  a  message  in
     RFC  822 format, as described in <B><A HREF="../man5/qmail-header.html">qmail-header</A>(5)</B>, subject to
     <B>&gt;From</B> <B>quoting</B> as described below.

<B>HOW</B> <B>A</B> <B>MESSAGE</B> <B>IS</B> <B>DELIVERED</B>
     Here is how a program appends a message to an <I>mbox</I> file.

     It first creates a <B>From_</B> line given the  message's  envelope
     sender  and  the  current  date.   If the envelope sender is
     empty (i.e., if this is a bounce message), the program  uses
     <B>MAILER-DAEMON</B>  instead.   If  the  envelope  sender contains
     spaces, tabs, or newlines, the program  replaces  them  with
     hyphens.

     The program then copies the message, applying <B>&gt;From</B>  <B>quoting</B>
     to  each  line.   <B>&gt;From</B>  <B>quoting</B>  ensures that the resulting
     lines are not <B>From_</B> lines:  the program prepends a <B>&gt;</B> to  any

     <B>From_</B> line, <B>&gt;From_</B> line, <B>&gt;&gt;From_</B> line, <B>&gt;&gt;&gt;From_</B> line, etc.

     Finally the program appends a blank line to the message.  If
     the  last  line of the message was a partial line, it writes
     two newlines; otherwise it writes one.

<B>HOW</B> <B>A</B> <B>MESSAGE</B> <B>IS</B> <B>READ</B>
     A reader scans through an <I>mbox</I> file looking for <B>From_</B> lines.
     Any <B>From_</B> line marks the beginning of a message.  The reader
     should not attempt to take advantage of the fact that  every
     <B>From_</B> line (past the beginning of the file) is preceded by a
     blank line.

     Once the reader finds a message,  it  extracts  a  (possibly
     corrupted)  envelope  sender  and  delivery  date out of the
     <B>From_</B> line.  It then reads until the next <B>From_</B> line or  end
     of  file,  whichever  comes  first.  It strips off the final
     blank line and deletes  the  quoting  of  <B>&gt;From_</B>  lines  and
     <B>&gt;&gt;From_</B> lines and so on.  The result is an RFC 822 message.

<B>COMMON</B> <B>MBOX</B> <B>VARIANTS</B>
     There  are  many  variants  of  <I>mbox</I>  format.   The  variant
     described above is <I>mboxrd</I> format, popularized by Rahul Dhesi
     in June 1995.

     The original <I>mboxo</I>  format  quotes  only  <B>From_</B>  lines,  not
     <B>&gt;From_</B> lines.  As a result it is impossible to tell whether

          Thanks for your interest.

     was quoted in the original message.  An <I>mboxrd</I>  reader  will
     always strip off the quoting.

     <I>mboxcl</I> format is like <I>mboxo</I> format, but includes a  Content-
     Length  field  with  the  number  of  bytes  in the message.
     <I>mboxcl2</I> format is like <I>mboxcl</I>  but  has  no  <B>&gt;From</B>  quoting.
     These  formats  are used by SVR4 mailers.  <I>mboxcl2</I> cannot be
     read safely by <I>mboxrd</I> readers.

<B>UNSPECIFIED</B> <B>DETAILS</B>
     There are many locking mechanisms for  <I>mbox</I>  files.   <B>qmail-</B>
     <B>local</B>  always  uses <B>flock</B> on systems that have it, otherwise
     <B>lockf</B>.

     The delivery date in a <B>From_</B> line does not  specify  a  time
     zone.   <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-local.html">qmail-local</A></B>  always creates the delivery date in GMT
     so that <I>mbox</I> files can be safely transported from  one  time
     zone to another.

     If the mtime on a nonempty <I>mbox</I> file  is  greater  than  the
     atime,  the file has new mail.  If the mtime is smaller than
     the atime, the new mail has been read.  If the atime  equals
     the  mtime, there is no way to tell whether the file has new
     mail, since <B>qmail-local</B> takes much less  than  a  second  to
     run.   One solution is for a mail reader to artificially set
     the atime to the mtime plus 1.  Then the file has  new  mail
     if and only if the atime is less than or equal to the mtime.

     Some mail readers place <B>Status</B> fields  in  each  message  to
     indicate which messages have been read.
