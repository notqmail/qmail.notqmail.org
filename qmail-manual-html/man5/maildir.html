<B>NAME</B>
     maildir - directory for incoming mail messages

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
     <I>maildir</I> is a structure for directories of incoming mail mes-
     sages.   It solves the reliability problems that plague <I><A HREF="../man5/mbox.html">mbox</A></I>
     files and <I>mh</I> folders.

<B>RELIABILITY</B> <B>ISSUES</B>
     A machine may crash while it is delivering a  message.   For
     both  <I>mbox</I>  files and <I>mh</I> folders this means that the message
     will be silently truncated.  Even worse: for <I>mbox</I> format, if
     the message is truncated in the middle of a line, it will be
     silently joined to the next  message.   The  mail  transport
     agent will try again later to deliver the message, but it is
     unacceptable that a corrupted message should show up at all.
     In  <I>maildir</I>,  every  message  is  guaranteed  complete  upon
     delivery.

     A machine may have two  programs  simultaneously  delivering
     mail  to the same user.  The <I>mbox</I> and <I>mh</I> formats require the
     programs to update a single central file.  If  the  programs
     do  not use some locking mechanism, the central file will be
     corrupted.  There are several <I>mbox</I> and  <I>mh</I>  locking  mechan-
     isms,  none  of  which  work portably and reliably.  In con-
     trast, in <I>maildir</I>, no locks are ever  necessary.   Different
     delivery processes never touch the same file.

     A user may try to delete messages from his  mailbox  at  the
     same  moment  that  the machine delivers a new message.  For
     <I>mbox</I> and <I>mh</I> formats, the user's  mail-reading  program  must
     know  what locking mechanism the mail-delivery programs use.
     In contrast, in <I>maildir</I>, any delivered message can be safely
     updated or deleted by a mail-reading program.

     Many sites use Sun's <B>Network</B> <B>F</B>a<B>il</B>ur<B>e</B> <B>System</B>  (NFS),  presum-
     ably because the operating system vendor does not offer any-
     thing else.  NFS exacerbates  all  of  the  above  problems.
     Some  NFS implementations don't provide <B>any</B> reliable locking
     mechanism.  With  <I>mbox</I>  and  <I>mh</I>  formats,  if  two  machines
     deliver  mail to the same user, or if a user reads mail any-
     where except the delivery machine, the  user's  mail  is  at
     risk.  <I>maildir</I> works without trouble over NFS.

<B>THE</B> <B>MAILDIR</B> <B>STRUCTURE</B>
     A directory in <I>maildir</I> format has three subdirectories,  all
     on the same filesystem:  <B>tmp</B>, <B>new</B>, and <B>cur</B>.

     Each file in <B>new</B> is a newly  delivered  mail  message.   The
     modification  time  of  the file is the delivery date of the
     message.  The message is delivered <I>without</I>  an  extra  UUCP-
     style  <B>From_</B> line, <I>without</I> any <B>&gt;From</B> quoting, and <I>without</I> an

     extra blank line at the end.  The message is normally in RFC
     822   format,   starting  with  a  <B>Return-Path</B>  line  and  a
     <B>Delivered-To</B> line, but it  could  contain  arbitrary  binary
     data.  It might not even end with a newline.

     Files in <B>cur</B> are just like files in <B>new</B>.  The big difference
     is that files in <B>cur</B> are no longer new mail:  they have been
     seen by the user's mail-reading program.

<B>HOW</B> <B>A</B> <B>MESSAGE</B> <B>IS</B> <B>DELIVERED</B>
     The <B>tmp</B> directory is used to ensure  reliable  delivery,  as
     discussed here.

     A program delivers a mail message in six steps.   First,  it
     <B>chdir()</B>s  to  the <I>maildir</I> directory.  Second, it <B>stat()s</B> the
     name <B>tmp/</B><I>time</I>.<I>pid</I>.<I>host</I>, where <I>time</I> is the number of  seconds
     since  the  beginning of 1970 GMT, <I>pid</I> is the program's pro-
     cess ID, and <I>host</I>  is  the  host  name.   Third,  if  <B>stat()</B>
     returned  anything other than ENOENT, the program sleeps for
     two seconds, updates <I>time</I>, and tries  the  <B>stat()</B>  again,  a
     limited  number  of  times.   Fourth,  the  program  creates
     <B>tmp/</B><I>time</I>.<I>pid</I>.<I>host</I>.  Fifth, the program <I>NFS</I>-<I>writes</I>  the  mes-
     sage  to  the  file.  Sixth, the program <B>link()</B>s the file to
     <B>new/</B><I>time</I>.<I>pid</I>.<I>host</I>.  At that instant  the  message  has  been
     successfully delivered.

     The delivery program is required to start  a  24-hour  timer
     before creating <B>tmp/</B><I>time</I>.<I>pid</I>.<I>host</I>, and to abort the delivery
     if the timer expires.  Upon <A HREF="../man3/error.html">error</A>, timeout, or  normal  com-
     pletion,  the  delivery  program  may  attempt  to  <B>unlink()</B>
     <B>tmp/</B><I>time</I>.<I>pid</I>.<I>host</I>.

     <I>NFS</I>-<I>writing</I> means (1) as usual, checking the number of bytes
     returned  from  each  <B>write()</B>  call; (2) calling <B>fsync()</B> and
     checking its return value; (3) calling <B>close()</B> and  checking
     its  return  value.   (Standard  NFS  implementations handle
     <B>fsync()</B> incorrectly but make up for it by abusing <B>close()</B>.)

<B>HOW</B> <B>A</B> <B>MESSAGE</B> <B>IS</B> <B>READ</B>
     A mail reader operates as follows.

     It looks through the <B>new</B> directory for  new  messages.   Say
     there  is  a new message, <B>new/</B><I>unique</I>.  The reader may freely
     display the contents of <B>new/</B><I>unique</I>,  delete  <B>new/</B><I>unique</I>,  or
     rename      <B>new/</B><I>unique</I>      as     <B>cur/</B><I>unique</I>:<I>info</I>.      See
     <B><A HREF="http://pobox.com/~djb/maildir.html">http://pobox.com/~djb/maildir.html</A></B> for the meaning of <I>info</I>.

     The reader is also expected to look through the  <B>tmp</B>  direc-
     tory  and  to clean up any old files found there.  A file in
     <B>tmp</B> may be safely removed if it has not been accessed in  36
     hours.

     It is a good idea for readers to skip all filenames  in  <B>new</B>
     and  <B>cur</B>  starting  with  a  dot.   Other than this, readers
     should not attempt to parse filenames.

<B>ENVIRONMENT</B> <B>VARIABLES</B>
     Mail readers supporting <I>maildir</I> use the <B>MAILDIR</B>  environment
     variable as the name of the user's primary mail directory.
