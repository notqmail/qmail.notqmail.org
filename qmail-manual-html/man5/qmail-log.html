<B>NAME</B>
     qmail-log - the <A HREF="../man7/qmail.html">qmail</A> activity record

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-send.html">qmail-send</A></B> prints a series of lines describing  its  activi-
     ties.  Each possible line is described below.

<B>STARTING</B> <B>AND</B> <B>STOPPING</B>
     <B>running</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is ready to deliver messages.

     <B>local</B> <B>deliveries</B> <B>will</B> <B>be</B> <B>put</B> <B>on</B>
          The local concurrency limit is 0,  so  <B>qmail-send</B>  will
          not perform any local deliveries.

     <B>remote</B> <B>deliveries</B> <B>will</B> <B>be</B> <B>put</B> <B>on</B>
          The remote concurrency limit is 0, so  <B>qmail-send</B>  will
          not perform any remote deliveries.

     <B>number</B> <B>of</B> <B>deliveries</B> <B>left</B> <B>before</B> <B>exiting:</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> wants to exit as soon as  possible,  usually
          because  it  was sent a TERM signal, but it has to <A HREF="../man3/wait.html">wait</A>
          for some deliveries to finish.  It will not  start  any
          new deliveries.

     <B>exiting</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is done.

<B>FATAL</B> <B>PROBLEMS</B>
     <B>alert:</B> <B>cannot</B> <B>start:</B> <B>...</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to prepare itself  for  delivering
          messages;  it  is giving up.  This normally indicates a
          serious configuration <A HREF="../man3/error.html">error</A>, but it can be caused by  a
          temporary lack of resources.

     <B>alert:</B> <B>oh</B> <B>no!</B> <B>lost</B> <B>...</B>
          One of the other daemons  has  died.   <B>qmail-send</B>  will
          exit as soon as possible.

<B>SERIOUS</B> <B>PROBLEMS</B>
     <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>append</B> <B>to</B> <B>bounce</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to  record  a  permanent  failure,
          usually because the disk is full.  This is a very seri-
          ous problem; <B>qmail-send</B> cannot proceed without  record-
          ing the results.  It will try again in ten seconds.

     <B>alert:</B> <B>out</B> <B>of</B> <B>memory...</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> tried to allocate more  memory  and  failed.
          It will try again in ten seconds.

     <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>opendir...</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is having trouble reading a file  list  from

          disk,  usually  because  the  system's  file descriptor
          table is full, but possibly because permissions are set
          incorrectly.  It will try again in ten seconds.

     <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>switch</B> <B>back...</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> was sent SIGHUP, and it is unable to reenter
          the  queue  directory.  This is a very serious problem;
          <B>qmail-send</B> cannot proceed outside the queue  directory.
          It will try again in ten seconds.

     <B>alert:</B> <B>unable</B> <B>to</B> <B>reread...</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> was sent SIGHUP, but it is  unable  to  read
          the  new controls.  It will continue operating with the
          original controls.

<B>MESSAGES</B>
     <B>new</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is going to  preprocess  a  queued  message.
          The message number, <I>m</I>, is its disk inode number.  After
          a message is removed from the queue, its number can  be
          reused immediately.

     <B>info</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I><B>:</B> <B>bytes</B> <I>b</I> <B>from</B>
          Message <I>m</I> contains <I>b</I> bytes; its envelope sender  is  <I>s</I>;
          it  was  queued by a user with user ID <I>u</I>.  <I>q</I> is a long-
          term queue identifier, the process  ID  of  the  <B>qmail-</B>
          <B>queue</B> that queued the message.

     <B>bounce</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I> <B>qp</B> <I>q</I>
          Message <I>m</I> had some delivery  failures.   The  long-term
          queue  identifier of the bounce (or double-bounce) mes-
          sage is <I>q</I>.

     <B>triple</B> <B>bounce:</B> <B>discarding</B> <B>...</B>
          Message <I>m</I> had some delivery failures, but it is already
          a  double-bounce  message,  so  it must be thrown away.
          Triple-bounce messages do not exist.

     <B>end</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is about to remove message <I>m</I> from the queue.

<B>DELIVERIES</B>
     <B>starting</B> <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>msg</B> <I>m</I> <B>to</B>
          <B>qmail-send</B> is telling <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-lspawn.html">qmail-lspawn</A></B> or  <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-rspawn.html">qmail-rspawn</A></B>  to
          deliver  message  <I>m</I>  to  one  recipient.   The delivery
          number, <I>d</I>, starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each  new
          delivery.

     <B>delivery</B> <I>d</I><B>:</B> <B>success:</B> <B>...</B>
          Delivery <I>d</I> was successful.

          Either <B>qmail-send</B> is unable to read a  recipient  list,
          or  it  is unable to read the envelope of a queued mes-
          sage, or it is out of memory.  Whatever it  was  doing,
