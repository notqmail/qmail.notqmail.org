<B>NAME</B>
     qmail-upgrade - user-visible differences between  <A HREF="../man7/qmail.html">qmail</A>  and
     sendmail

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
     You will notice some differences when  the  system  switches
     from <B>sendmail</B> to <B>qmail</B>.

     1.   <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-local.html">qmail-local</A></B> sends  incoming  mail  to  <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/Mailbox</B>  by
          default, not <B>/usr/spool/mail/</B><I>you</I>.  Your system adminis-
          trator has changed your <B>MAIL</B>  environment  variable  so
          that   your   mail   reader   looks  for  <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/Mailbox</B>.
          (<B>/usr/spool/mail</B> is a massive security problem.)

     2.   <B>qmail-local</B> pays no attention to <B>.forward</B>.   It  has  a
          much  better  mechanism, <B>.qmail</B>, so that you can handle
          not only forwarding but even your  own  mailing  lists.
          See below for more details.

     3.   <B>qmail-local</B> pays no attention  to  <B>/etc/aliases</B>.   Your
          system  administrator  can  use  the  <B>.qmail</B>  mechanism
          instead.  See below.

     4.   <B>qmail</B> does not support the <B>\</B><I>you</I> mechanism for  ignoring
          aliases.   The  <B>.qmail</B> mechanism is much more flexible;
          see below.

     5.   <B><A HREF="../man8/qmail-inject.html">qmail-inject</A></B> has a completely different philosophy from
          <B>sendmail</B>   on   interpreting  non-fully-qualified  host
          names.  It uses fixed rules, not DNS.  Some examples at
          UIC:

               russet -&gt; russet.math.uic.edu
               newton -&gt; newton.math.uic.edu
               ut.ee  -&gt; ut.ee  (a host in Estonia)
               ut.ee+ -&gt; ut.ee.uic.edu
               uicvm+ -&gt; uicvm.uic.edu

          Here the <I>default</I> <I>domain</I> <I>name</I> (for hosts  without  dots)
          is <B>math.uic.edu</B>, and the <I>plus</I> <I>domain</I> <I>name</I> is <B>uic.edu</B>.

     6.   Unlike  <B>sendmail</B>,  <B>qmail-inject</B>  doesn't  replace  host
          names  with  canonical  names.   Example:  <B>qmail-inject</B>
          won't  change  <B>postmaster@ftp.cs.berkeley.edu</B>  in  your
          header to <B>postmaster@kohler.cs.berkeley.edu</B>.

     7.   <B>qmail-local</B> adds  a  new  field,  <B>Delivered-To</B>,  before
          every  delivery.   It uses the contents of <B>Delivered-To</B>
          to prevent mail forwarding loops.

     8.   If you send a message with only <B>Bcc</B> recipients,  <B>qmail-</B>
          <B>inject</B>  will add <B>Cc:</B> <B>recipient</B> <B>list</B> <B>not</B> <B>shown:;</B>, rather

          than <B>sendmail</B>'s privacy-invading  <B>Apparently-To</B>  header
          field.

<B>QMAIL</B> <B>MAILING</B> <B>LISTS</B>
     <B>sendmail</B> deals with aliases, forwarding, and  mailing  lists
     at the very heart of the mail system.

     <B>qmail</B> takes a radically different approach.   It  gives  you
     the power to set up your own mailing lists without pestering
     your system administrator.

     Under <B>qmail</B>, you are in charge of all <A HREF="../man5/addresses.html">addresses</A> of the  form
     <I>you</I><B>-</B><I>anything</I>.  The delivery of <I>you</I><B>-</B><I>anything</I> is controlled by
     <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/.qmail-</B><I>anything</I>, a file in your home directory.

     For example, if you want to set up  a  bug-of-the-month-club
     mailing   list,  you  can  put  a  list  of  addresses  into
     <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/.qmail-botmc</B>.  Any mail to <I>you</I><B>-botmc</B> will be  forwarded
     to  all  of  those  addresses.  Mail directly to <I>you</I> is con-
     trolled by <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/.qmail</B>.  You can even set  up  a  catch-all,
     <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/.qmail-default</B>, to handle unknown <I>you</I><B>-</B> addresses.

     Your <B>.qmail</B> files, like your old <B>.forward</B>, may  list  files,
     forwarding addresses, or other programs to run.  (But beware
     that the syntax is a bit  different;  see  <B>dot-qmail(5)</B>  for
     more details.)  <B>qmail-local</B> automatically detects forwarding
     loops the instant they occur, even if they happen indirectly
     through other hosts.

     As a helpful special <A HREF="../man3/case.html">case</A>, if a <B>.qmail</B>  file  is  empty,  it
     refers   to   <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/Mailbox</B>.    For  example,  if  you  touch
     <B>~</B><I>you</I><B>/.qmail-direct</B>, mail for <I>you</I><B>-direct</B> will act  like  <B>\</B><I>you</I>
     did under <B>sendmail</B>.

     Addresses that don't contain a username are handled  by  the
     <B>alias</B>  user.  For example, your system administrator has set
     up <B>~alias/.qmail-postmaster</B> to handle mail  for  <B>Postmaster</B>.
     (Note  to administrators:  <B>~alias</B> doesn't apply to addresses
     that start with a user name, with certain exceptions.)
