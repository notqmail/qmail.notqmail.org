Sorry for the late reply - I'm way behind in everything lately.

Qmail is VERY EASY to use with phquery.  We use it here (pdx.edu).
All you need is a ~alias/.qmail-default file that reads:

|/usr/local/qibin/phquery $EXT

You might want to check that the address is one that phquery can handle
(some versions crash on 1 letter aliases).  I've decided I'd rather remove
the occasional misaddressed letter from the queue by hand until I have
time to upgrade and/or fix phquery. 

Note that if there is a local username, mail will get delivered to that
address first - we used to have a bunch of hacks in our sendmail.cf file
to achieve this, so this is an advantage for us.  If you don't want this
to happen, you will need to put a line in virtual domains like:
	
	nwu.edu:phquery

and then instead of a ~alias/.qmail-default file create a
~alias/.qmail-phquery-default file containing:

|/usr/local/qibin/phquery $EXT2

(Warning, this last line is from memory, not my production site - I tested
it months ago but never used it in production and don't have my test setup
anymore.) 

I also create a ~alias/.qmail-alias file that goes to postmaster or
/dev/null, because some phquery messages go out with an address of
alias@<hostname> and bounce. 

I already ranted about phquery on the list once this month so I'll skip
that.  Feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
