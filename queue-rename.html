Don't use queue-fix.  It has a bug that can lose mail for you.  I have
alerted the author about the bug, and hopefully he will fix it.  But
in the mean time, I cannot recommend the program.

If your problem is due to a restore or moving your queue to a new file
system, one solution is to have messages from your old queue in
/var/qmail/queue.old, a brand new empty queue in /var/qmail/queue, and
run the following script (which requires GNU find):

#!/bin/sh -x
cd /var/qmail || exit 1
find queue.old/mess -type f -printf '%f %i\n' |
 awk '{print $1, $1%23, $2, $2%23}' |
 while read oldi oldd newi newd; do
  mv queue.old/mess/$oldd/$oldi queue/mess/$newd/$newi
  mv queue.old/info/$oldd/$oldi queue/info/$newd/$newi
  test -f queue.old/local/$oldd/$oldi &&
       mv queue.old/local/$oldd/$oldi queue/local/$newd/$newi
  test -f queue.old/remote/$oldd/$oldi &&
       mv queue.old/remote/$oldd/$oldi queue/remote/$newd/$newi
  test -f queue.old/bounce/$oldi &&
       mv queue.old/bounce/$oldi queue/bounce/$newi
  test -f queue.old/todo/$oldi &&
       mv queue.old/todo/$oldi queue/todo/$newi
 done
