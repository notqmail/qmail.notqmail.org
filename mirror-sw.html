    <h1>Mirror Manager</h1>

<p>qmail.org has many mirrors.  To let people know which mirrors are
well-maintained, I check every mirror every day using a script.  The
script fetches http://qmail.example.com/timestamp.html, and compares
it to the one on mirror.qmail.org.  If that file is unavailable for
any reason, or is badly formatted, a note is inserted into the listing
of mirrors.  Also, if the mirror has been unavailable in the past two
weeks, and they've been unavailable for more than four times in the past
several months, they get a red bar next to their name, indicating the
number of days of outage.</p>

<p>If there is a note, then the script has also sent email to the
responsible person at the mirroring site.  I call this the Auto-Annoy
feature.  If that email bounces (yes, you'd think that qmail mirror
admins would have well-administered email systems, but no), then that
adds two days to the red bar.</p>

<p>That's how it currently works.  In the future, I'm going to modify it
to also check each site to see if the site also responds to qmail.org
as the name of the server.  If it does, then the site will be added
into a round-robin record for qmail.org.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="watchmirror2">mirroring software<a> itself.</p>
